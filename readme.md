Problem:Zero-waste is a way of living that minimizes waste by prioritizing recycling, reducing consumption, and reusing items as much as possible. It promotes making more conscious decisions, such as purchasing only essentials and finding ways to prevent items from ending up in the trash, all with the goal of reducing the waste we generate.
Solution: YES! Zero-waste is vital as it addresses several key issues. Environmentally, it cuts down on pollution and preserves natural resources. Economically, it reduces waste management expenses and promotes more sustainable business models. In terms of health, it decreases harmful waste that could pollute the air, water, and soil, safeguarding both human health and ecosystems

Why we chose Stellar: Easy to use and implement changes in a collaborative environment.
