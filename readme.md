Problem:Zero-waste is a way of living that minimizes waste by prioritizing recycling, reducing consumption, and reusing items as much as possible. It promotes making more conscious decisions, such as purchasing only essentials and finding ways to prevent items from ending up in the trash, all with the goal of reducing the waste we generate.
Solution: YES! Zero-waste is vital as it addresses several key issues. Environmentally, it cuts down on pollution and preserves natural resources. Economically, it reduces waste management expenses and promotes more sustainable business models. In terms of health, it decreases harmful waste that could pollute the air, water, and soil, safeguarding both human health and ecosystems

Why we chose Stellar: Easy to use and implement changes in a collaborative environment.

Short Summary
GreenPass is a Web3 platform that rewards real-world eco-action with dynamic
NFT badges and perks from local sustainable businesses.
Full Description
GreenPass addresses the lack of engagement in local environmental efforts by
making eco-events easy to discover and rewarding participation with NFT
“passport stamps.” These dynamic NFTs act as proof-of-impact and unlock
real-world perks from eco-conscious partners. The platform bridges the gap
between digital identity and environmental action, promoting sustainable habits
while supporting local businesses.
Using blockchain tech, GreenPass ensures verified attendance at events (via QR
scan + wallet verification), gamifies user engagement with collectible badges and
ranks, and builds a transparent, decentralized record of community involvement.
This motivates users to take repeated eco-action while enabling organizers and
businesses to track and reward genuine participation.
Technical Description
GreenPass leverages the Stellar SDK and Freighter Wallet for seamless
blockchain integration. Key features enabled by Stellar include:
● Custom Asset Issuance: Used to mint unique NFT event badges directly
on-chain.
● Low-Cost Transactions: Enabled fast, affordable minting and transfers at
scale.
● Freighter Wallet Integration: Provided secure and user-friendly wallet
connection for attendees.
● Metadata Storage: IPFS (via nft.storage) was used to store dynamic NFT
visuals and details.

These tools allowed us to create a frictionless, eco-friendly Web3 experience,
ensuring on-site badge claiming and real-world reward validation could happen
instantly and sustainably.
Description of How Your Interaction with the Relevant Blockchain Works:
● GreenPass uses the Stellar blockchain to mint and manage dynamic NFT
“passport stamps” that serve as verified proof of event participation. Here's
how the interaction works:
● User Authentication:
Users log in via the Freighter Wallet, connecting their Stellar wallet address to the
platform.
● Event Participation & Verification:
At the event, the organizer displays a QR code linked to a unique event NFT. The
user scans it through the app, which verifies attendance and triggers
